To initialize new anchor project - anchor init <new-workspace-name>

1. The .anchor folder: It includes the most recent program logs and a local ledger that is used for testing
2. The app folder: An empty folder that you can use to hold your frontend if you use a monorepo
3. The programs folder: This folder contains your programs. It can contain multiple but initially only contains a program with the same name as <new-workspace-name>. This program already contains a lib.rs file with some sample code.
4. The tests folder: The folder that contains your E2E tests. It will already include a file that tests the sample code in the programs/<new-workspace-name>.
5. The migrations folder: In this folder you can save your deploy and migration scripts for your programs.
6. The Anchor.toml file: This file configures workspace wide settings for your programs. Initially, it configures
   The addresses of your programs on localnet ([programs.localnet])
   A registry your program can be pushed to ([registry])
   A provider which can be used in your tests ([provider])
   Scripts that Anchor executes for you ([scripts]). The test script is run when running anchor test. You can run your own scripts with anchor run <script_name>.

declare_id! macro defines the address of our program once it is deployed, either localnet, devnet, or mainnet. By default, it is filled with a dummy value that you should update with a real one once you are ready to deploy.

#[program]
pub mod hello_anchor {
use super::*;
pub fn initialize(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {
ok(())
}
}

Thatâ€™s our main entry point; there would be all of the logic we want to implement within our program. Thatâ€™s how Anchor implements entrypoint.rs, instruction.rs, and processor.rs.

pub fn initialize(ctx: Context) -> Result<()> {
ok(())
}
Anchor requires a list of accounts that will be used by some instruction, thatâ€™s why each function declared under `#[program]` macro should have a required parameter of type `Context<T>`, thatâ€™s analog of `accounts: &[AccountInfo]`.
we can declare any amount of functions under `#[program]` macro, and all of them will be accessible to the client code.

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Initialize {}
This instruction defines the context of initializing the entrypoint and is used when you are interested in interacting with some account data; in a simple case, itâ€™s empty as we donâ€™t need any account data for initialization for now. You may think about this as an Anchor approach to managing the state of the account that we have in `state.rs` file in the staking-app project.


An Anchor program consists of three parts:

ðŸ‘‰ The program module marked with `#[program]` is where you define your business logic. You do so by writing functions that can be called by clients or other programs.  
ðŸ‘‰ The Accounts structs which are marked with `#[derive(Accounts)]` is where you define which accounts your instruction expects and which constraints these accounts should adhere to. You do this via two constructs: Types and constraints.  
ðŸ‘‰ The `declare_id!` macro creates an ID field that stores the address of your program. Anchor uses this hardcoded ID for security checks and allows other crates to access your program's address.
